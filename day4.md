# VLSI Fabrication and Layout Design – Hands-on Session Repository

## Overview
This repository contains notes, diagrams, and hands-on observations from the VLSI practical session.
In this session, we learned about semiconductor fabrication and basics of layout design used in VLSI circuits.



## Objectives
- Understand what fabrication is
- Learn different steps involved in IC fabrication
- Get basic knowledge of layout design
- Perform hands-on layout design practice



## What is Fabrication?
Fabrication is the process of manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) on a silicon wafer using a series of physical and chemical steps.



## Steps Involved in Fabrication
1. Silicon wafer preparation
2. Oxidation
3. Photolithography
4. Etching
5. Diffusion / Ion Implantation
6. Metallization
7. Passivation
8. Testing and Packaging



## Layout Design Basics
Layout design is the physical representation of a circuit on silicon.  
It uses different layers like:
- Active layer
- Poly layer
- Metal layers
- Contact and via layers

Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) are important verification steps.



## Hands-on Session
In the practical session:
- We observed the fabrication flow
- Learned layout layers and rules





## Conclusion
This session helped us understand how ICs are fabricated and how circuits are physically designed on silicon.  
It gave us practical exposure to VLSI design flow.
